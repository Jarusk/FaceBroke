# FaceBroke

A deliberately hackable social network app


# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

### Bug naming
Two branches of code exist here:
-  *master* --> for the working app.
-  *vulnerable* --> where intentional vulnerabilities have been introduced and tagged


In order to accurately track these 'bugs', we need a naming convention. Current idea is:

`{filename}-{previous commit hash}-{starting line of bug}`
